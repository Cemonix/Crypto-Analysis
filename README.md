# Vigenère Cipher Cracking in Python

This repository contains Python scripts for cracking Vigenère ciphers using various techniques, including the Kasiski method, index of coincidence, and chi-square key decryption.

## Introduction

The Vigenère cipher is a classic encryption technique that uses a keyword to encrypt plaintext. This repository provides Python implementations of methods to crack Vigenère ciphers without knowledge of the key.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cemonix/Crypto-Analysis
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```
